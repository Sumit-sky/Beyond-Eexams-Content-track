# Beyond-Exams-Content-track
We are **Fire Penguins** working on the **content track challenge**.
Solution-
We will go by creating nearly 9-10 modules in each course where-
the 1st-2nd module will contain basic knowledge of the topics  
the rest of the modules will contain one project with a complete youtube video on it 
will also contain reading materials and a few topics which are important to learn to complete the project.
